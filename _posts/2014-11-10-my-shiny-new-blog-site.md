Ok, I just finished migrating my blogs from my old site (http://ebbypeter.wordpress.com) to this new site. The question is why I moved?  
Actually there is no real reason.  

* Was WordPress site giving me enough things I needed for my blog site? Yes.  
* Was I happy with it? Hmm maybe…  

There was something I couldn’t put my finger on, that wanted me to migrate away right from the day I started. It might be because of the limited customization capability (I am not complaining), or it might be the knowledge that I need to stick with the frameworks that WordPress free tier provides me.  
One of the first posts that I had written in my old blog was about learning PHP and creating / customizing template to my heart’s content. The noob I am, didn’t know that it is not possible, although I found it out within the next few days. Learned basics of PHP anyway.  

###So I wanted my own blog site…
Soon after I started blogging, I realized that I wanted my own blog site. Tried different options starting from WordPress to my favorite SharePoint. Every time I find a new platform and try it, I stop writing blogs altogether with the aim of writing these posts to my new blog site.  
SharePoint was the most interesting of all. Being a SharePoint developer myself, I spent quite some time on this platform. The problem here was, I wanted to do too much and end up losing focus. I believe, I have 4 separate SharePoint 2013 blog themes in various stages of development in my vm.   
I will work on them, complete it and maybe release them as free templates, and open source the code in GitHub. Working on these templates gave me great insights for my day projects.  

So in a nutshell, I wanted to write my blogs in my own blog site. I start building a site, after a while lose focus / get involved in another project. This cycle went too long that my last blog entry is now 3 years old. :(  

###A Reboot was required…
So I needed a reboot. I was reading some articles and came across GitHub pages. Started reading articles on it and found out about Jekyll. Jekyll was interesting and I was truly intrigued.  

Coincidence maybe, that very night my wife was writing down some recipes to a notebook (Psss… She is an amazing cook, but don’t tell her ok… :)). She has some very yummy family recipes too… I asked her to blog it. She said she is considering it and asked about my blog. I opened my blog to show her and she made the observation that the last one is over 3 years old. Frankly I did not realize it. Time flies…   

So I needed to start asap… GitHub and Jekyll was the first that came to my mind… Had a test repository made that very night and reviewed Jekyll. I liked what I saw and decided that this is going to be my blogging platform.  

I started working on my blog the next day evening (Friday). Found a good theme (HPSTR from mademistakes.com) to base my blog theme and started customizing. I am a windows man, so the first step was installing Ubuntu in a VM. 

By Saturday night I had the site theme ready, and also a very angry wife. Apparently I was glued in front of my laptop the whole day (although I beg to differ). 
We ended up making a beautiful rainbow cake the next day. But that is a story for some other day.  

Long story short, By Sunday night, I got all my old blogs migrated successfully to the new site. It was altogether painless. The only major work I needed to do was to move all the images to the new location and change the urls in the post itself.  

And so I am here with my new blog. All ready to blog away… :)
