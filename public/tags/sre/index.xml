      <description>Azure&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure is genuinely reliable. That&amp;rsquo;s exactly the problem. The more stable the platform, the easier it is to mistake platform health for system health, and that gap is where the expensive outages live. Availability is an architectural choice, not a SKU.</description>

      <title>Your DR Plan Has Never Been Tested</title>

      <description>Most Azure DR tests confirm the secondary came up. They don&amp;rsquo;t confirm your RTO is real, your RPO commitment holds under load, or that failback won&amp;rsquo;t silently destroy the incident window. Here&amp;rsquo;s how to test DR honestly, with exit criteria that actually prove the plan works.</description>

      <description>Retries are load, not safety. Without exponential backoff and jitter, your retry logic doesn&amp;rsquo;t protect against outages, it causes them. This post covers the mechanics of retry storms, five anti-patterns found in real production code, and what correct retry design actually looks like across layered Azure architectures.</description>

      <title>Autoscaling Is Not a Recovery Strategy</title>

      <description>Autoscaling is not a recovery strategy. It&amp;rsquo;s an elasticity tool, and knowing the difference is what separates teams that survive incidents from teams that just watch their instance count go up while users experience the outage anyway.</description>
