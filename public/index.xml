      <description>Retries are load, not safety. Without exponential backoff and jitter, your retry logic doesn&amp;rsquo;t protect against outages, it causes them. This post covers the mechanics of retry storms, five anti-patterns found in real production code, and what correct retry design actually looks like across layered Azure architectures.</description>

      <description>Your team enabled logging everywhere, a responsible move. Then the Azure bill arrived. This post traces exactly why Log Analytics costs spiral without warning, what the AzureDiagnostics table is quietly doing to your budget, and how resource-specific tables plus DCR transformations give you back control.</description>

      <description>Autoscaling is not a recovery strategy. It&amp;rsquo;s an elasticity tool, and knowing the difference is what separates teams that survive incidents from teams that just watch their instance count go up while users experience the outage anyway.</description>

      <description>Windows Notepad has had a hidden logging trick since 1992 - type .LOG as the first line of a file and it automatically appends a timestamp every time you open it. I missed it when I moved to VS Code, so I built dotLOG to bring it back.</description>
